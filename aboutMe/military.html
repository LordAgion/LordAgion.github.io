                        <h2>Enlistment</h2>
                       <p>
                           I enlisted in the 122nd Indiana Air National Guard on September of 2012 during my Seinor Year in high school.  I graduated from Carroll Highschool, Fort Wayne, Indiana in May of 2013.
                       </p>
                       <h2>Security Forces</h2>
                       <p>
                           My carrer field was Security Forces.  Security Forces provide three crucial elements for the Air Force, Secuirty, Infantry, and Law Enforcement.  Security Forces is all intents and purpose the military police for the Air Force.  We were once known as Security Police.
                       </p>
                       <h2>Major Events</h2>
                       <p>
                           In my time of service I have help provide Security Detail for two airshows that were held at my base the latest was in June of 2019.  These are high stress times with extended shifts to provide a service to the greater local population.
                           During the November Elections in 2018, President Trump landed in the 122nd Fighter Wing.  I participated in the security detail in preperation of and during Mr. President Trumps arrive and departure.  Along with the standard and additonal base operations, other agencies included the Secret Service, Air Force One, Marine One, Fort Wayne Police Department, Allen County Sheriffs, and Indiana State Troopers.

                       <h2>Deployments</h2>
                        <p>
                            In my service, I have only been on one deployment.  During July of 2016 to Febuaray of 2017, I was deployed to Kuwait and worked at Al Mubarak Airbase along in two squads of Security Forces.  For six months, our unit and an Ohio Air National Guard unit were in charged of the saftey of personal and euipment that did, was, and would be on base.  No major or minor infractions made its way on base and no security incident was created.  During this deployment, there was a lot of down time.  During the down time, I self taught how mod in one of the games I loved to play at the time.  The game was Company of Heroes 2.  With time spent, it created a foundation of programming that set me on this path.  Funny unrelated story, the first day we landed 21 July, 2016.  This was the hottest tempature ever recorded in that hemishpere. 54°C, or 129.2°F.  It only got cooler from then on.
                        </p>
